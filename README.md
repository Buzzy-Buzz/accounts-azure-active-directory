# Accounts-Azure-Active-Directory
Adds support for authentication using Azure Active Directory and the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing meteor applications to authenticate against (copies of) an organisation's Active Directory.

# Configuration
Due to the number of steps in setting up an Azure Active Directory and adding an application against it, the in-app configuration guidelines are necessarily short on detail. I recommend reading the following documentation should you get stuck:

 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding
 - https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-GraphAPI-DotNet (read step 3, modifying the specified parameters for your own application)
