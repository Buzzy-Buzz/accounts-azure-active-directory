#What does this package do
Adds single sign-on integration with Azure Active Directory.

#What does this package allow me to do?
This package was written to allow the development of  meteor apps for the (windows) enterprise world. It seems to me that a large barrier to corporate acceptance of meteor having to remember a million different sets of credentials. This package allows users to authenticate using their Active Directory credentials.

#What's Azure Active Directory
Essentially it's Active Directory in the cloud. You can ask your Ops/Systems team to create a mirror image of your enterprise installation or sign up for a free account and add your users manually.

# Configuration
Please refer to the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/djluck/accounts-azure-active-directory/wiki/Getting-accounts-azure-active-directory-up-and-running) for a guide to configuring this package.
